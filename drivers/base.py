'''Base classes for all device drivers.

Requirements for a driver:
- Modules                      => get_modules
    - Includes SFPs
- Vlans                        => get_vlans
    - Purely bridged vlans entities, vlan interfaces are handled by interfaces
- Interfaces                   => get_interfaces
    - VLAN
    - Parent interfaces
    -
- IP Addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) => get_ipaddresses
- Neighbours                   => get_neighbours

        The incoming parameters will be from the config.py DEV_* with the DEV_
        prefix removed and then lowercased (e.g. DEV_USERNAME becomes username).
        The hostname parameter is also added to this set of parameters and is
        the current device's hostname / IP.

        These parameters are then filtered and mapped using the _connect_params:

        Example:
        _connect_params = {
            'hostname': 'host',
            'username': 'user',
            'keyfile':  'ssh_private_key_file',
        }

        will only accept the hostname, username, password and keyfile
        parameters and map them to host, user and ssh_private_key_file
        respectively.

        This setup should make allowing the drivers to share parameters that make
        sense and break out the ones that don't. An example of this could be
        defining DEV_ROUTEROS_PORT with a matching mapping of:
            'routeros_port': 'port',
        in the dictionary. The routeros driver will know what port to use for its
        connections without requiring any changes to the other drivers.
